# RadiantBee
(c) F4GKR and F5OEO

RadiantBee is a tentative to use a UAV for antenna calibration. The UAV transmits a specific signal (chirp) and telemetry to say where it is. The base station receives the signal, locks on the chirp by using a matched filter to estimate channel and decodes lat/lon/altitude and UAV attitude to estimate the transmitting conditions
